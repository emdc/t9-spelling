This is a test application that translates a string of text into a sequence of numbers for input through T9. Now support only English, but you can add your dictionary ;)

Using is very simple:

```
$ t9-spelling "<message>"
```

This command will output digits sequence into console. 

Notes:
* The space symbol means a delay in entering.
* Punctuation marks are not supported.

## Dependencies

[Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) â€” header-only unit testing library. They add as git submodule to `${PROJECT_DIR}/third_party/`.

## Build

This project uses a CMake, so the build is very simple:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cd ..
```

Binaries will be placed in `${PROJECT_DIR}/bin/`.

## Examples

```
$ t9-spelling "hello world"
  _______ ___     _____            _ _ _
 |__   __/ _ \   / ____|          | | (_)
    | | | (_) | | (___  _ __   ___| | |_ _ __   __ _
    | |  \__, |  \___ \| '_ \ / _ \ | | | '_ \ / _` |
    | |    / /   ____) | |_) |  __/ | | | | | | (_| |
    |_|   /_/   |_____/| .__/ \___|_|_|_|_| |_|\__, |
                       | |                      __/ |
                       |_|                     |___/

Input string is "hello world"
Result T9 sequence: 4433555 555666096667775553
```

    | | | (_) | | (___  _ __   ___| | |_ _ __   __ _
    | |  \__, |  \___ \| '_ \ / _ \ | | | '_ \ / _` |
    | |    / /   ____) | |_) |  __/ | | | | | | (_| |
    |_|   /_/   |_____/| .__/ \___|_|_|_|_| |_|\__, |
                       | |                      __/ |
                       |_|                     |___/

Oh no! We catch exception:
  "No expected symbol in dictionary 'number by symbol'. By first, check language of input message.".
Input string is "hello, world"
```

## Testing

For testing build the application and run command:

```
$ t9-spelling-test
```

Now I provide 9 test cases.
